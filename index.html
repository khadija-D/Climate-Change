<h1>Climate Activism: Changing the World One Waterbottle at a Time</h1>
<h2>The Issue: What is Climate Change</h2>
    <p>
        Climate change is defined as the long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns. Since the 1800s, humans have been adding to this drastically with the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels add things called greenhouse into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases are gases in the atmosphere that trap heat. This causes the overall temperature of the Earth to rise, which can have detrimental consequences.
    </p>
    <h2>Why should we care?</h2>
        <p>
            Now, I understand if you're thinking, why should I care? What are these so called "detrimental consequences". 
            When the Earth heats we see things like:
            <ul>
                <li>more heat waves and heat-related illnesses</li>
                <li>rising sea levels</li>
                <li>forest fires</li>
                <li>more severe weather</li>
                <li>droughts</li>
                <li>warming oceans</li>
                <li>melting oceans etc.</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>
            Through this webpage, we hope to to inform people of the consequences of climate change, and inspire them to act against it. We hope you realize that climate change can be impacted by individual decisions. We want you to realize that even their small contribution can help protect the Earth for future generations to come.
            </p>

        <h2>Last Words</h2>
        <p>
                This is our collaboration animation. This story is about a boy walking to school and seeing a waterbottle on the ground. He decides to ignore it, but then climate change starts to take affect, until the Earth is no more. Then, he wakes up and realizes it was a dream. When he walks to school in real life, he sees the same waterbottle, and decides to pick it up and recycle it. This represents the internal conflict we all struggle with on a daily basis. Do we really want to take time out of our day to recycle something or turn off something, no matter how short the amount of time the task will take? It's our decision what we want to do or not do, but we have to remember that the descion we make doesn't just affect us, it affects the Earth and the people on it. So, hopefully this inspired you to pick up that waterbottle you pass by, or turn off that light next time. </p>
